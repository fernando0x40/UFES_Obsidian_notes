[WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
A **minimum spanning tree** (**MST**) or **minimum weight spanning tree** is a subset of the edges of a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_graph "Connected graph"), edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") together, without any [cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory) "Cycle (graph theory)") and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a [spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree "Spanning tree") whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a **minimum spanning forest**, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its [connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory) "Connected component (graph theory)"). ^b0de0e
